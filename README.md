Clone the repository to your local machine. Each sub-project has its own `requirements.txt` file. Navigate to the sub-project directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

Each sub-project can be run independently. Navigate to the sub-project directory and run the main Python file (usually named after the sub-project, like `tictactoe.py` or `degrees.py`).

## Projects

- `project-zero` includes two sub-projects:

  - `degrees`: A Python program that determines how many "degrees of separation" apart two actors are.
  - `tictactoe`: A Python implementation of Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent.

- `project-one` includes two sub-projects:
  - `knights`: A logic puzzle solver implemented in Python.
  - `minesweeper`: An AI that plays Minesweeper, also implemented in Python.
